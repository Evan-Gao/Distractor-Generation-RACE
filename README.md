## Distractor Generation: A New Task
In the task of Distractor Generation (**DG**), we aim at generating reasonable `distractors` (wrong options) for multiple choices questions (MCQs) in reading comprehension.

The generated distractors should:
- be longer and *semantic-rich*
- be *semantically related* to the reading comprehension question
- *not be paraphrases* of the correct answer option
- be *grammatically consistent* with the question, especially for questions with a blank in the end

Here is an example from our dataset. The question, options and their relevant
sentences in the article are marked with the same color.

#### Real-world Applications
- Help the preparation of MCQ reading comprehension datasets
    - The existence of distractors fail existing content-matching SOTA reading comprehension on MCQs like RACE dataset
    - Large datasets can boost the performance of MCQ reading comprehension systems
- Alleviate instructors' workload in designing MCQs for students
    - Poor distractor options can make the questions almost trivial to solve
    - Reasonable distractors are time-consuming to design

## Dataset
The data used in our paper is transformed from [RACE Reading Comprehension Dataset](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D17-1082).
We prune the distractors which have `no semantic relevance` with the article or require some `world knowledge` to generate.

The processed data is put in the `/data/` directory. Please uncompress it first.

Here is the dataset statistics.

`Note` Due to a [bug](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/issues/1574) in spacy, the released data is different from that we used when submitting the paper. Experimental results can be different.
